# Simple email program to send in an email to someone

To get this to work you'll need to download the client configuration which can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python "google's python api quickstart")

Once downloaded, place it in the folder that this .py file is in and use python to run it.

## Note that this is a very simple program with not many security checks that I created in a rush. Use it with care.
## Another point is to NEVER let anyone else have access to your 'token.pickle' file which will be created once gmail authentication finishes.
